OpenGL FrameWork.

GLFW is a free, open source, portable framework for OpenGL application development. In short, it is a link library that constitutes a powerful API for handling operating system specific tasks, such as opening an OpenGL window and reading keyboard, mouse and joystick input. 

It also provides functions for reading a high precision timer, querying OpenGL extensions, creating and synchronizing threads, reading textures from files and more... 

GLFW is available for both Windows and Unix-like systems (running the X Window System), such as Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, IRIX etc.
