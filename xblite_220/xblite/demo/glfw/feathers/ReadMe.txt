"Flock of Feathers" by Andreas Gustafsson (C) 2001
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Introduction]
This is an entry to the OpenGL Challenge (www.oglchallenge.com) 
It shows a flock  of feathers (drawn using Bezier-generated triangle strips)
that fly through the air, affected by the wind (although the calculations
aren't all that correct!) and with a nice skybox as the background.
You will need the GLUT-libraries to run this program (and to compile
the source code)

[Known bugs]
I don't z-sort the feathers before drawing them, which can cause some bugs
in the alpha-blending. 
And as always my source code can be somewhat messy, but that's not a bug,
it's a feature! :)
