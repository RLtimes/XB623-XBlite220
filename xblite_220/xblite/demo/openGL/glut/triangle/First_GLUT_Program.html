 alt="screenshot">In this tutorial I'll cover the basics of setting up and
using OpenGL and GLUT with VC++. I'll take you through initializing your
GLUT display, opening a window and displaying a triangle in it. The program
you'll learn how to create is a foundation for more complex GLUT projects
you might want to undertake in the future.</p>
  
<h1>What is GLUT?</h1>
<p>GLUT stands for OpenGL Utility Toolkit. It's an API for OpenGL written
by Mark Kilgard. GLUT is very easy to set up and use compared to traditional
Win32 OpenGL, making it great for beginners. Because GLUT handles input and
window setup, GLUT code is not platform specific, meaning any application
you write will run on just about any platform (until you start adding DirectSound
code, that is...).</p>

<h1>Getting the GLUT files</h1>
<p>You can download the latest version of glut from <a
 href="http://www.xmission.com/%7Enate/glut.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you've downloaded and unzipped the file, copy glut32.dll to your windows\system
directory, glut32.lib to your compiler's lib directory and glut.h to your
complier's include\gl directory. Now you're ready to roll.</p>
<h1>Creating your GLUT project</h1>
<p>Start up VC++, then create an empty console application.</p>
<p>Link to glut32.lib, glu32.lib and opengl32.lib in project &gt; settings</p>
<h1>The Program</h1>
<p>This code includes headers for the libraries we'll be using and declares
our functions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">#include &lt;windows.h&gt;               <span
 class="codecomment">//header file for windows</span>
#include &lt;gl\gl.h&gt;                 <span
 class="codecomment">//header file for openGL</span>
#include &lt;gl\glu.h&gt;                <span
 class="codecomment">//header file for the openGL utility library</span>
#include &lt;gl\glut.h&gt;               <span
 class="codecomment">//header file for GLUT</span>

static void redraw(void);          <span
 class="codecomment">//declarations</span>
int main(int argc, char **argv);
  </pre>
</blockquote>
   
<p>The argc variable contains the number of arguments passed to our program,
while argv is a pointer to the arguments. We don't need to worry about them
particularly, except to pass them to glutInit() so it can process any command
line parameters sent to GLUT. The glutInit() function initialises the GLUT
framework. </p>
<p>The glutInitDisplayMode function is used to set up the display mode. We'll
call it with the following flags:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GLUT_RGB</b> specifies we want an RGB colour buffer in our window
  </li>
  <li><b>GLUT_DOUBLE</b>specifies we want a double buffer. Double buffering
enables us to finish drawing before our image is sent to the screen, preventing
flicker.   </li>
  <li><b>GLUT_DEPTH</b> specifies we want a depth buffer. The depth buffer
ensures that objects near the camera will always be on top of those further
away. The output tends to be a bit messy otherwise. While this isn't necessary
when we're only drawing a single triangle, it's good practice, so we'll include
it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>The glutCreateWindow() function creates the window we're going to be drawing
in. glutDisplayFunc() specifies the function we'll use to draw the display,
which we'll have to write later. GLUT will call this function whenever the
display needs updating.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">int main(int argc, char **argv)<br>{<br>  glutInit(&amp;argc,argv);                                       <span
 class="codecomment">//initializes the GLUT framework</span>
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_DEPTH);   <span
 class="codecomment">//sets up the display mode</span>
  glutCreateWindow("My first GLUT program");                  <span
 class="codecomment">//creates a window</span>
  glutDisplayFunc(redraw);                                    <span
 class="codecomment">//specifies our redraw function</span>
  </pre>
</blockquote>
   
<p>Next we need to set up the projection matrix. The projection matrix is
a 4x4 matrix which is used to translate points from their positions relative
to the camera to their positions on the screen. We use it to specify how our
scene will be projected. In order to change it we need to call glMatrixMode()
with GL_PROJECTION. The gluPerspective() function creates a projection matrix
with a perspective transform for us. All we need do is specify the view angle,
aspect ratio and the postitions of the near and far clipping planes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">  glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);   <span
 class="codecomment">//changes the current matrix to the projection matrix</span>

  <span
 class="codecomment">//sets up the projection matrix for a perspective transform</span>
  gluPerspective(45,     <span
 class="codecomment">//view angle</span>
                 1.0,    <span
 class="codecomment">//aspect ratio</span>
                 10.0,   <span
 class="codecomment">//near clip</span>
                 200.0); <span
 class="codecomment">//far clip</span>
  </pre>
</blockquote>
   
<p>When we're done we switch the current matrix to the modelview matrix. The
modelview matrix is a 4x4 matrix used to transform points from their actual
positions (in world space) into their positions relative to the camera. It's
the matrix we use to specify our camera postion and the position of anything
we draw. The glutMainLoop() function is the main loop of the GLUT framework
and we need to call it next.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">  glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);   <span
 class="codecomment">//changes the current matrix to the modelview matrix</span>

  glutMainLoop();               <span
 class="codecomment">//the main loop of the GLUT framework</span>

  return 0;
}
  </pre>
</blockquote>
   
<p>Next we need to create our redraw() function which will draw our triangle.
glClear() called with GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT and GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT will clear
the colour and depth buffers in our window. We need to do this before we start
drawing on it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">static void redraw(void)                               <span
 class="codecomment">//all drawing code goes here</span>
{
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);  <span
 class="codecomment">//clears the colour and depth buffers</span>
  </pre>
</blockquote>
   
<p>Now we're almost ready to start drawing. First though we need to store
our camera's position ((0,0,0) on the x, y and z axes - the center of our
world) with glPushMatrix() and then move it 100 on the Z axis, effectively
moving the camera backwards, enabling us to see what we're drawing. Because
the modelview matrix specifies where we are drawing relative to the camera,
to move the camera we need to translate the matrix by the reverse of the translation
we want from the camera, so to move the camera (0,0,100) we translate the
modelview matrix (0,0,-100). This has the same effect as moving our triangle
(0,0,-100).</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">  glPushMatrix();         <span class="codecomment">//saves the current matrix on the top of the matrix stack</span>
  glTranslatef(0,0,-100); <span
 class="codecomment">//translates the current matrix 0 in x, 0 in y and -100 in z</span>
  </pre>
</blockquote>
   
<p>Now we're going to draw the triangle. In order to do this, we need to call
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES), which tells OpenGL we're going to begin drawing triangles.
OpenGL will then treat every group of three vertices as a triangle, and when
glEnd() is called it will render the triangle(s) to our window.</p>
<p>Between the glBegin() and glEnd() we need to specify 3 vertices with glVertex3f.
The three values specified in the each glVertex3f() call are the vertex's
X, Y and Z coordinates in world space. We can also specify a colour for each
of the vertices by using glColor3f() before each call to glVertex3f. The parameters
we call glColor3f() with are the red, green and blue elements (from 0 to
1), which make up the colour. OpenGL will then blend the colours across the
triangle.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">  glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);  <span class="codecomment">//tells OpenGL that we're going to start drawing triangles</span>
  glColor3f(1,0,0);       <span
 class="codecomment">//sets the current colour to red</span>
  glVertex3f(-30,-30,0);  <span
 class="codecomment">//specifies the first vertex of our triangle</span>
  
  glColor3f(0,1,0);       <span
 class="codecomment">//sets the current colour to green</span>
  glVertex3f(30,-30,0);   <span
 class="codecomment">//specifies the second vertex of our triangle</span>
  
  glColor3f(0,0,1);       <span
 class="codecomment">//sets the current colour to blue</span>
  glVertex3f(-30,30,0);   <span
 class="codecomment">//specifies the third vertex of our triangle</span>
  glEnd();                <span
 class="codecomment">//tells OpenGL that we've finished drawing</span>
  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Next we retrieve our saved matrix from the top of the matrix stack with
glPopMatrix(), setting the camera's position back to (0,0,0), ready for the
next frame. Because we're using double buffering, all drawing has been done
on the back buffer (the invisible buffer). Now the frame is completed we call
glutSwapBuffers() to swap the front buffer (the visible buffer) and back
buffer over, making what we have drawn visible.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">  glPopMatrix();          <span class="codecomment">//retrieves our saved matrix from the top of the matrix stack</span>
  glutSwapBuffers();      <span
 class="codecomment">//swaps the front and back buffers</span>
}                         <span
 class="codecomment">//The end of our program!</span>
  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That's it! The end of our program and this tutorial. Build the program
and try it out. </p>
<p>Hopefully with the help of this tutorial you should now be able to build
and initialize a GLUT program and draw triangles. If you want to give some
