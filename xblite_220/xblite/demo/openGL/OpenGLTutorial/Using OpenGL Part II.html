with 		a large multicolored triangle in it. Try resizing the window and 		watch
the triangle resize along with it. OnSize defines the viewport 		and the
viewing coordinates. The viewport is the area of the window 		that the OpenGL
commands can draw into. It is set in this program 		by calling  	</big></font>
      </big></p>
      <pre><big><font face="courier new" size="1" color="Navy"><big>glViewport(0, 0, width, height);</big></font></big></pre>
      <p><big>	<font face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"
 size="1"><big>		This sets the lower left hand corner of the viewport to
the lower 		left hand corner of the window and sets the height and width
to 		that of the window. The parameters passed into the function are 		in
screen coordinates. Try changing the glViewport command in 		OnSize to the
following. Then compile and run the program to see 		what happens. 	</big></font>
      </big></p>
      <pre><big><font face="courier new" size="1" color="Navy"><big>glViewport(width/4, height/4, width/2, height/2);</big></font></big></pre>
      <p><big>	<font face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"
 size="1"><big>		Make the window taller than it is wide. Because the viewport
is 		smaller than the screen, part of the triangle will be clipped. 		Change
the code back to the way it was originally 	</big></font></big></p>
      <p><big>	<font face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"
 size="1"><big>		The next command called in OnSize is glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION).
		OpenGL maintains three internal matrices to control various transformations.
		These matrices are name <i>Projection</i>, <i>ModelView</i>, and 		<i>Texture</i>.
The Projection matrix handles transformations 		from the eye coordinates
to clip coordinates. The ModelView matrix 		converts object coordinates to
eye coordinates. The Texture matrix 		converts textures from the coordinates
they are defined in to 		the coordinates needed to map them onto a surface.
glMatrixMode 		sets which of these matrices will be affected by matrix operations.
		Don't worry if you don't understand these right now, I'll explain  		them
as needed. 	</big></font></big></p>
      <p><big>	<font face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"
 size="1"><big>		We call glLoadIdentity to initialize the project matrix.
gluOrtho2D 		sets the project matrix to display a two dimension orthogonal
		image. The numbers passed into this function define the space 		within
which you may draw. This space is known as the world coordinates. 		We now
initialize the ModelView matrix and leave OpenGL in this 		matrix mode. Matrix
operations (which include transformations) 		carried out while in the ModelView
mode will affect the location 		and shape of any object drawn. For example
if we called "glRotated(30, 		0, 0, 1)" just before our glBegin call in OnPaint,
our triangle 		would be rotated 30 degrees around the lower left corner of
the 		screen. We will look at this more a little later. (For those of 		you
who have used IRIS GL, we have just set up the equivalent 		of calling mmode(MSINGLE).
There is an entire section in the VC++ 		online documentation detailing the
differences between IRIS GL 		and OpenGL for those who are interested.) 	</big></font>
      </big></p>
      <p><big>	<font face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"
 size="1"><big>		OnPaint is the beast that actually draws our triangle. First
we 		clear our ModelView matrix. This isn't really necessary since 		we aren't
doing any transformations, but I added it just in case 		we decide to do
any. Next we clear the color buffer (which in 		this case happens to be the
screen, but could be a print buffer 		or bitmap depending on the type of
device context you used to 		create rendering context ). The next call is
glBegin(GL_POLYGON). 		This function changes the state of the rendering context.
From 		an object oriented perspective, it creates an internal object 		of
type GL_POLYGON, which is defined by all commands issued until 		glEnd()
is called. We make three glColor4f and three glVertex2f 		calls to define
our triangle. <br>
	</big></font></big></p>
      <p><big>	<font face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"
 size="1"><big>		Let me take a moment at this point to discuss the naming
conventions 		OpenGL uses. All OpenGLcommands use the prefix "gl". 		There
are also a number of "glu" commands which are 		considered "GL Utilities".
These "glu" commands 		are simply combinations of "gl" commands that perform
		commonly useful tasks - like setting up 2-D orthographic matrices. 		Most
"gl" commands have a number of variants that each 		take different data types.
The glVertex2f command, for instance, 		defines a vertex using two floats.
There are other variants ranging 		from four doubles to an array of two shorts.
Read the list of 		glVertex calls in the online documentation and you will
feel like 		you are counting off an eternal list. glVertex2d, glVertex2f,
		glVertex3i, glVertex3s, glVertex2sv, glVertex3dv... 	</big></font></big></p>
      <p><big>	<font face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"
 size="1"><big>		The definition for our triangle uses the following technique.
		We call glColor4f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f). This sets the current 		color
to Red by specifying the Red component to 1 and the Green 		and Blue components
to 0. We then define a vertex at point (100,50) 		in our world coordinates
by calling glVertex2f(100.0f, 50.0f). 		We now have a red vertex at point
(100,50). We repeat this process, 		setting the color to Green and Blue respectively,
for the next 		two vertices. The call to glEnd ends the definition of this
polygon. 		At this point there should still be nothing on the screen. OpenGL
		will save the list of commands in a buffer until you call glFlush. 		glFlush
causes these commands to be executes. OpenGL automatically 		interpolates
the colors between each of the points to give you 		the multihued triangle
you see on the screen.  	</big></font></big></p>

 size="1"><big>		Play with some of the different shapes you can create with
glBegin. 		There is a list of modes and valid commands to create shapes below.
		In the next version of this program, we will move our drawing 		routines
into the document class. I will also show you how to 		use the basic transforms
and the importance of pushing and popping 		matrices onto and off of the
matrix stack. 	</big></font></big></p>
