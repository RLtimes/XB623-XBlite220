      <p>When you installed Linux, you installed a lot of cool
programs, many of which you use every day. At the
same time hundreds of little utilities also got installed, simply
because they were required by the bigger,
more elaborate applications. However, many of these little utilities
are extremely useful in their own right.
This article describes one of these second-class utilities: m4.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><b>m4</b></span> is a macro processor,
meaning that it copies its input to the output,
expanding macros along the way. In this regard it's similar to another
macro processor you're probably
already familiar with: cpp (C Pre-Processor). Like cpp, m4 originally
was written as the pre-processor for a
programming language (Rational FORTRAN); however, m4 is much more
powerful and feature-rich than cpp, which
makes it much more useful than just defining constants in programs.</p>
      <p>Being a macro processor, m4 certainly provides the ability to
define simple macros, but it goes much
further. You also can define parameterized macros (macros with
arguments), conditionally include text into
the output stream, do looping via recursion, run a shell command and
insert its output into the output
stream, include a file, perform simple string operations (length,
substring search, regexp search, etc.),
perform simple integer arithmetic and much more.</p>
      <p>The examples that follow illustrate many of the features of
m4, but this article can't do justice to
everything m4 can do for you. Take a look at the info page (see
Resources) for a complete description. Also,
the examples below are abbreviated versions of m4 macros that I
actually use. You can find the full source at
my web page listed in Resources.</p>
      <p>A word of warning from the m4 info page:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p>Some people [find] m4 to be fairly addictive...learning how
to write complex m4 sets of macros....Once
really addicted, users pursue writing of sophisticated m4 applications
even to solve simple
problems....Beware that m4 may be dangerous for the health of
compulsive programmers.</p>

      <h2 class="title"><a name="N0x850ca10.0x8573c0c"></a>Defining and
Using Macros</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The basic tool of m4 is the macro. Macros are defined with the
define command. For example, <b>define(`hello', `Hello, World')</b>
defines a macro called
hello. Notice the quote characters ` and '.
These group words together to form phrases, and when they surround a
single word they inhibit macro
expansion. Usually, m4 will expand macros within both the macro name
and the macro body unless you tell it
not to by quoting.</p>
      <p>Like cpp, you don't need any special commands or prefix
characters to use macros. Everywhere the macro
name appears in the input stream, m4 will substitute the macro body.</p>
      <p>To run m4, simply give it the name of the file(s) to use as
input. It reads through the input, expanding
macros as it goes, and generates text on the standard output.</p>
      <p>Assume we have the following file called sample.m4:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>define(`hello', `Hello, World')<br>hello, welcome to m4!<br></tt><br>      </pre>
      <p>If we run this file through m4 with the command</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>m4 sample.m4 &gt; sample.txt<br></tt><br>      </pre>
it produces the following output:
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>Hello, World, welcome to m4!<br></tt><br>      </pre>
      <br>
      <br>
      </div>

      <h2 class="title"><a name="N0x850ca10.0x8573df0"></a>HTML Example</h2>
      </div>
      <p>As I said above, m4 goes beyond simple macros. This example
demonstrates some of m4's advanced features by
defining some macros to ensure that HTML pages all have the same look
and feel. HTML purists probably could
do this with JavaScript and CSS, but it's so easy with m4 and doesn't
require anything special from the
browser.</p>
      <p>Four macros are defined: one to produce the HTML header, a
second to create a banner at the top of the
HTML page, a third to create banners within an HTML page (like section
headers) and a final one to do some
housekeeping at the end of the page. We put these macros into a file
called html.m4 and use it as a macro
package later.</p>
      <p>First, the macro to start an HTML page:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>define(`START_HTML',<br>`&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;<br>   charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;<br>  &lt;meta name="Author" content="D. Robert Adams"&gt;<br>  &lt;title&gt;$1&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body text="#000000"<br>  ifdef(`BACKGROUND_IMAGE',<br>        `background="BACKGROUND_IMAGE"')<br>  bgcolor="#e5e5e5" link="#3333ff"<br>vlink="#000099"<br>  alink="#ffffff"&gt;<br>')<br></tt><br>      </pre>
      <p>Line one defines a macro called START_HTML that expands to all
the text that follows. Note the use of $1
on line seven. This expands to the first macro argument, which will
become the page's title (see the next
section for how these macros are used). Also note the use of m4's ifdef
macro on line 11. <span class="bold"><b>ifdef</b></span> checks if a
macro has been defined. If it has, it includes the text given in the
second argument. In this case, ifdef checks if BACKGROUND_IMAGE has
been defined. If it has, we include the
HTML code to use the image as the web page's background.</p>
      <p>Next comes the page header macro:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>define(`PAGE_HEADER',<br>`&lt;table border="0" background="steel.jpg"<br>width="100%"&gt;<br>  &lt;tr&gt;<br>    &lt;td align="left"&gt;$1&lt;/td&gt;<br>    &lt;td align="right"&gt;$2&lt;/td&gt;<br>  &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;<br>&lt;div align=right&gt;<br>  Last Modified: esyscmd(`date')<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>')<br></tt><br>      </pre>
      <p>Again, note the use of $1 and $2 on lines four and five that
get expanded with macro arguments. Further,
note the esyscmd() macro on line nine. <span class="bold"><b>esyscmd()</b></span>
tells m4 to run the given
shell command and insert its output at the given location. In this
case, we run ``date'' to produce a
timestamp in our document.</p>
      <p>Next, we create the macro to make a section banner within the
page. This uses nothing you haven't seen
before:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>define(`HTML_BANNER',<br>`&lt;table border="0"<br>background="steel.jpg"<br>width="100%"&gt;<br>  &lt;tr&gt;<br>    &lt;td&gt;<br>      &lt;img src="$2"&gt;<br>      &lt;h2&gt;$1&lt;/h2&gt;<br>    &lt;/td&gt;<br>  &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;<br>')<br></tt><br>      </pre>
      <p>The final piece necessary is the macro to close the HTML
``body'' and ``html'' tags:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>define(`END_HTML', `&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;')<br></tt><br>      </pre>
Given the above four macros, creating a web page is extraordinarily
easy. Create a file (index.m4) that
contains calls to our HTML macros. The only thing new is the include
macro that inserts our HTML macros:
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>include(`html.m4')<br>define(`BACKGROUND_IMAGE', `bg.jpg')<br>START_HTML(`Sample Page')<br>PAGE_HEADER(`computer.jpg', `Sample HTML<br>Page')<br>HTML_BANNER(`img1.jpg', `News')<br>HTML_BANNER(`img2.jpg', `Downloads')<br>END_HTML<br></tt><br>      </pre>
Once we've declared the macros and a file that uses them, the final
step is to run m4 to create the HTML
page. The command is:
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>m4 index.m4 &gt; index.html<br></tt><br>      </pre>
That's it! With just seven lines of code we create a fully functional
HTML document. By using the macros to
create other HTML pages, every page will have the same look and feel.
Furthermore, we can change the look by
simply changing the macro definitions and re-creating the HTML files. <br>

      <h2 class="title"><a name="N0x850ca10.0x8574108"></a>A Simple
Database Example</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In this second example, we create a ``database'' of exam
questions for a course. The goals are 1) to
manage exam questions in a single repository, 2) to be able to create a
LaTeX-format exam by simply choosing
which questions to include and 3) to produce an answer key with equally
little effort.</p>
      <p>The question database consists of an m4 macro for each
question. We store the macros in a file called
questions.m4. For example:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>define(`QUESTION_1',<br>  `Why did the chicken cross the road?<br>  ANSWER(1in, `To get to the other side')<br>')<br></tt><br>      </pre>
      <p>Obviously, this macro will be expanded with the question
itself, but note the use of the embedded macro
ANSWER. It expands to one inch of vertical space if we're producing the
exam, otherwise it expands to the
answer if we're producing an answer key. ANSWER is defined as:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>define(ANSWER, ifdef(`ANSWER_KEY', `Answer: $2',<br>`\vspace*{$1}'))<br></tt><br>      </pre>
If ANSWER_KEY is defined, we include the answer ($2), otherwise we
include some vertical space ($1) so the
student can write in the answer. <br>
      <br>
      <p>Using the question macros is as easy as using the HTML macros.
The complete exam code is stored in a file
called exam.m4:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>include(examMacros.m4)<br>EXAM_HEADER(`JOKE 101', `Fall 2001',<br>`First Exam')<br>include(questions.m4)<br>QUESTION_1<br>QUESTION_2<br>EXAM_TRAILER<br></tt><br>      </pre>
      <p>The ``include'' on line one includes the code for EXAM_HEADER
and EXAM_TRAILER that generate boilerplate
LaTeX at the top and bottom of the exam. Line three includes the
question macros we just created. Lines four
and five include two questions from the database.</p>
      <p>To create an exam, we run the command <b>m4 exam.m4 &gt;
exam.tex</b>. Because ANSWER_KEY was never
defined, each question will include space for an answer. To create an
answer key, we use m4's command-line
options to temporarily define an ANSWER_KEY macro:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><tt>m4 -DANSWER_KEY exam.m4 &gt; exam.key.tex<br></tt><br>      </pre>

      </div>
      <p><span class="bold"><b>m4</b></span> is a tool that has
applications in an endless number of domains.
Anywhere you want to reduce duplication of effort, m4 can help. It is
feature-rich enough that you can do
almost anything and produce any kind of content you may wish. I hope
I've given you enough to whet your
appetite for m4 and to give you an appreciation for what m4 can do for
you. Happy macro writing!</p>
