XBLite for Windows v1.10
December 2002

The following is a list of known bugs. If anyone can
help to identify the cause of the bug or resolve it, I
would be very grateful. 

Note that these are new XBLite related bugs and this list
does not reflect the bugs carried over from XBasic.

1. The function XbmDIBto24Bit () in Xbm library does not
   properly convert a 24-bit bitmap to 4-bit.

2. Some demo programs do not function correctly in Win95:

   splittext.x
   tsplit.x
