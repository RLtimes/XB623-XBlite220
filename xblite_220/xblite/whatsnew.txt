XBLite for Windows
What's New

v.2.2.0
- Added support for line continuation using underscore character "_" at the end
  of a line. See the console demo helloworld.x.

- Compiler optimizations and bug fixes.

- PROGRAM statement parameter must match program's filename, otherwise an error
  will be displayed. This statement is only required for libraries.

- xsed v1.21 released with many new features and xsed HTML Help manual updated.

- Added several new demo programs:
    helloworld.x
    fontresource.x
    mbb.x
    filesearch.x
    polygon_rendering.x
    sendkey.x

v.2.1.0
- Added static libraries for all xblite DLLs, eg, xst_s.lib can be
  imported and will replace the need to link to xbl.dll. All static
  libraries have _s suffix. The utility buildlib.exe can be used to
  create static libraries. Static libraries are linked at compile-time
  by the linker so they are incorporated into the final executable, thus
  removing the need for external DLLs. Special thanks to Greg Heller for
  making this happen!

- Added the ability to use the m4 macro preprocessor using a -m4 compiler option.
  This allows user defined macros and the ability to include
  external files into your programs.

- The keyword COMMENT has been removed.

- The keyword ASM is now used instead of ! as the inline assembly marker.

- The ? character can be used as an equivalent to using a PRINT statement.

- New intrinsics ROUND, ROUNDNE, and CEIL have been added.

- New CSV functions by Alan Gent have been added to Xsx library:
  XstBuildDataArray
  XstLoadCompositeDataArray
  XstLoadData
  XstSaveCompositeDataArray
  XstSaveDataArray

- New unicode functions by Alan Gent have been added to Xsx library:
  XstAnsiToUnicode
  XstUnicodeToAnsi

- Two new Xma functions by Alan Gent, Fmod and Fround.

- The runtime library xbl.dll has been reduced in size to 71kb.

- Added several new demo programs:
  editsubclass.x	- a demo to subclass edit control
  filetree.x		- a tree control which displays a file/directory tree
  rtracer.x		- raytracing program(s)
  docksplitter.x 	- a custom splitter control now used in xsed
  fround.x		- test of Fround function
  m4test.x		- test of using m4 preprocessor
  seive.x		- seive algorithm
  printdirect.x		- printing direct to printer w/o spooling
  quiner.x		- a new quine using ? as PRINT
  unicode.x		- demo of XstAnsiToUnicode function
  comparray1.x		- demo of new CSV functions
  comparray2.x		- ""

- The xblite distribution has been split into two parts, with the
  compiler, libraries, and demos in one part, and the source code
  in the second part.

- Fixed bugs in handling longdouble arrays.

- Updated xsed editor to use new splitter control and added command line 
  options to compiler options dialog box.

v.2.0.1
- Fixed minor compiler bugs
- Fixed bug in XstGetCPUName
- Updated template makefiles so they handle all xblite file extensions

FAQ for  XBLite v2.0.1
Q. Why is Spasm still part of the distribution? 
A. Spasm is still used for building some parts of the instrinsic functions,
   contained in the static library xblib.lib.  When those functions are all
   converted (a painstakingly slow task) we can kiss Spasm goodbye completely.
   The use of Spasm vs. GoAsm for that code has no effect whatsoever on the
   compiler efficiency or code output - it is not used by the compiler.

Q. Why are xcowlite.dll and xcowlite.x so much smaller? 
A. The intrinsic functions were stripped out, and the compiler was
   significantly simplified.

Q. What is the xblib.lib library? 
A. This is a static library that contains all the intrinsic functions.
   It is linked at compile time, there is no xblib.dll.

Q. Are there any new optimizations?  Are my programs going to be faster? 
A. Yes, but nothing that really uses the power of GoAsm yet, like MMX code.
   The goal of this release was more to build a stable compiler that emits
   GoAsm code, and I hope we have accomplished that.

Q. What is the most significant optimization? 
A. The function prolog is more efficient.  To see the difference, compile
   and run the benchmark.x program with the former build, and compare it
   with the benchmark.x results of the current build.  On my P4 the time
   to run was about 35% of the previous.  On my AMD the results are less
   dramatic, but still significant.  The reason is that the AMD runs the
   "unoptimized" code much better than the Pentium, so the opmization was
   not as dramatic on the AMD.

Q. Why are pelles' utilities polib, polink, & porc included  in the \bin folder?
A. These tools can be used to build slightly smaller executables.
   Use the template makefile pelles.xxx. In the future, we hope to migrate
   to the full suite of GO tools.  

v.2.0.0
- Greg Heller has modified the xblite compiler so that it now emits
    assembly for the 64-bit GoAsm assembler.
- see http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/ for details on this 64-bit assembler
- the previous xbasic assembler spasm has now been replaced by goasm
- assembly files now use *.asm file extensions

    within every function or an error occurs
- added many demos by Michael McElligott, including glfw library demos
    see alphagui.x, avi.x, consoletimer.x, hexviewer.x, keylog.x, quine.x
