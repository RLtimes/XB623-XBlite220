 for Windows XBasic
 for Linux XBasic


 #####  IMPORTANT  #####

 Read the "readme.txt" file with this distribution.



 #####  v5.0005  #####

 BUG : Windows95/98/NT
 The default color of the text insert cursor on the
 XuiTextLine grid was similar to the background color
 with some video cards.

 FIX : The color of the text insert cursor has always
 been configurable from the Option menu in the main window
 with "option + color text cursor".  The default color of
 the XuiTextLine has been changed to hopefully make this
 problem less common.


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 BUG : Windows95/98 only
 When programs running in the PDE are paused or hit a
 breakpoint, the mouse is sometimes disabled.  Clicking
 on any XBasic window does nothing.  This problem does
 not occur in WindowsNT or Linux.

 FIX : This bug in Window95 is not yet fixed, but you
 can free the mouse by clicking on the desktop or any
 window belonging to another application, or by pressing
 any keyboard key.


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 BUG : Windows95 only
 Windows95 has a bug that prevents programs from
 opening themselves.  If the XBasic console window
 displays a message that says XBasic cannot load
 external symbols or cannot compile programs in
 the PDE, then try the following work around.

 FIX : Make a duplicate of xb.dll called xb.dup.

 1: terminate the PDE          ".fq" or "FileQuit"
 2: start up an MSDOS window
 3: get into \xb directory     "cd \xb"
 4: copy xb.dll to xb.dup      "copy xb.dll xb.dup"

 XBasic should now be able to compile programs.
 When you get a new version of Windows95, delete
 xb.dup and try again.  The original release of
 WindowsNT had the same bug, but it was fixed in
 the next release.  Windows95 is not yet fixed.
 Windows98 seems to work okay without xb.dup .


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 BUG : Windows only
 When building standalone executables, the linker says
 it doesn't recognize some linker command line switches.

 FIX : Older WindowsNT 3.1 linkers do not support
 some of the command line switches in win32.mak.
 You might be able to kludge a modified win32.mak
 file together from the ntwin32.mak file that came
 with your WindowsNT 3.1 development tools, but a
 much better solution is to get the current version
 of the Win32 linker, LINK.EXE.  Attempts to link
 with the old linker and updated win32.mak sometimes
 succeed, but not reliably.  To develop programs for
 all versions of Windows and WindowsNT, you need to
 get the new linker.


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 BUG : Windows only
 When building executables and libraries, the
 linker sometimes warns of a duplicate _malloc
 symbol in MSVCRT20.DLL.

 FIX : This will not hurt anything.  Eventually
 MSVCRTxx.DLL should not reference _malloc says
 Microsoft support.  If the linker warns of a
 duplicate _malloc reference in one of the XBasic
 files you MUST change the makefile so the linker
 sees the XBasic version of _malloc before the
 MSVCRT20 version of _malloc.  Otherwise your
 executables will not work.


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 BUG : Linux only
 When windows appear they are not displayed in the
 specified location.  Generally they appear 4 pixels
 left and 22 pixels above the specified location.

 FIX : This problem does not usually occur when
 you are running the "fvwm" window manager, but
 the problem has been reported with some other
 window managers.  The reason for the difference
 is the window managers and is being investigated.


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 LIMITATION : Linux only
 Linux XBasic cannot produce "dynamic link libraries" or
 "DLLs" since the ELF specification foolishly requires
 the compiler generate PIC aka position independent code,
 which XBasic cannot do without a rewrite.  This does not
 prevent an XBasic program from calling functions in DLLs,
 however.  In fact Linux XBasic itself is linked with the
 DLL versions of the X-Windows "xlib" library, the standard
 operating system library, and the ELF support library.

 FIX : This limitation is under investigation.


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 BUG : Linux only
 On some computers, Linux XBasic may take a long time
 to "initialize" before program compilation begins.
 This is probably due to the enormous size of the ELF
 symbol table imbedded in Linux XBasic.  The symbol table
 is enormous because all local as well as global symbols
 are put in the ELF binary.  As soon as I find out how
 to tell the linker not to put these local symbols in
 the binary, the "Initialize" step will speed up.

 FIX : This problem is under investigation.


 #####  v4.0013  #####

 NOTE : Linux only
 Though exceptions do exist in Windows and UNIX, the usual
 "text selection paradyme" on Windows and UNIX differs.

 In XBasic, a few UNIX applications, and most Windows apps,
 text can be selected at any time, but the text is not
 transferred to the interapplication clipboard until the
 user enters ^X (cut) or ^C (copy) or some other keystrokes
 or pulldown menu selection.

 In most UNIX applications and a few Windows applications,
 text is transferred to the interapplication clipboard as
 soon as it is selected.

 All implementations of XBasic read from and write to the
 interapplication clipboard in response to explicit user
 actions, typically:

  ^C and ^Insert copy the selected text and
  put it in the interapplication clipboard.

  ^X and Delete cut the selected text and
  put it in the interapplication clipboard.

  ^V and Insert paste the interapplication clipboard
  into the current or previous text cursor position.

 To copy from a typical UNIX "xterm" window into XBasic
 requires that you select the source text in the "xterm"
 window, click the mouse cursor at the desired insert
 position in the desired XBasic text grid, then enter
 ^V or Insert to transfer the text from the clipboard
 to the text grid.

 To copy from XBasic to a typical "xterm" window, copy or
 cut text from an XBasic grid in the normal way, then point
 the mouse cursor at the desired position in the "xterm"
 window and press the center mouse button to transfer the
 text from the clipboard to the "xterm" window.


 #####  all versions  #####

 NOTE : Linux only
 Make sure the .fvwmrc file in your home directory
 enables "SmartPlacement" or "RandomPlacement".
 The above filename will be different if your
 window manager is not "fvwm".

 Make sure any "NoPPosition" line is removed, or
 the line is disabled by a "#" prefix, like this:
 # NoPPosition

 FIX : this problem is under investigation


 #####  all versions  #####

 LIMITATION : Linux only
 Linux XBasic cannot produce "dynamic link libraries"
 aka "DLLs" since the ELF specification requires the
 compiler generate PIC aka position independent code,
 which XBasic cannot do without a substantial rewrite.
 This does not prevent an XBasic program from calling
 functions in DLLs, however - in fact Linux XBasic itself
 is linked with the DLL versions of the X-Windows "xlib"
 library, the standard operating system library, and
 the ELF support library.

 FIX : this limitation is under investigation.
